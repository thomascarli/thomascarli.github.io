				hi, my name is Thomas Carli.  I like to make things. <br />
				Sometimes I make <a class='no-style' href="https://github.com/thomascarli" target="_blank">websites</a> and sometimes I don't. <br />

				My current project is a Spotify App called <a class='no-style' href="https://www.hearmuffin.com" target="_blank">Hearmuffin</a>. <br />
